% 2018-10-09 test the .ipnb file, can find the problem when run on local computer
# running the text prediction tutorial
Because the source code running environment is different, some code become can't be compiler.
Solution: read the source code, and debug the the bugs.

I find the solution about debug on github issues.
  - maybe the solution is not explicitly shown, but some people solve it.
  - The error is: TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
  
 By looking in the source code for sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer, I found they were using the regex r"(?u)\b\w\w+\b" in their tokenizer and this allowed me a work around by doing

tokenizer = lambda doc: re.compile(r"(?u)\b\w\w+\b").findall(doc)
explainer = LimeTextExplainer(class_names=class_names, split_expression=tokenizer)
exp = explainer.explain_instance(newsgroups_test.data[idx], c.predict_proba, num_features=6)

# finally I use this solution to the source code, and can runing it.


from lime.lime_text import LimeTextExplainer
#explainer = LimeTextExplainer(class_names=class_names)
tokenizer = lambda doc: re.compile(r"(?u)\b\w\w+\b").findall(doc)
explainer = LimeTextExplainer(class_names=class_names, split_expression=tokenizer)
